    <h2><u>What is the introduction of math?</u></h2>
    <p>Mathematics is the <mark>science and study of quality, structure. space. and change.</mark> Mathematicians seek out patterns, formulate new conjectures, and establish truth by rigorous deduction from appropriately chosen axioms and definitions.</p>
    <p>There is debate over whether mathematical objects such as numbers and points exist naturally or are human creations. The mathematician Benjamin Peirce called mathematics " the science that draws necessary conclusions. <mark>Albert Einstein</mark>, on the other hand, stated that <q><u>as far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality,/lity are not certain:  and as far as they are certain.  they do not refer to reality</u></q></p>

    <p><u>Today  mathematics is used throu . w. d as fat a v fields including  natural science.</u>i4eineeriug.  medicine and the social sciences. Applied mathematics, the branch of mathematics concerned with application of <b>mathematical knowledge</b> to other fields, inspires and makes use of new mathematical discoveries and sometimes leads to the development of entirely new disciplines. Mathematicians also engage in pure mathematics, or mathematics for its own sake.wahout having any application in mind, although practical applications for what began as pure mathematics are often discovered later.</p>

    <h3><u>Introduction to Chemistry</u></h3>
    <p><mark>Chemistry </mark>is the study of matter and the ways in which different forms of matter combine with each other.<u>You study chemistry because it helps you to understand the world around you,</u>Everything you touch or taste or smell is a <b>chemical,</b> and the interactions of these chemicals with each other define our universe.<mark><u><i>Chemistry forms the fundamental basis for biologts and medicen.</i></u></mark>From the structure of proteins and nucleic acids, to the design, synthesis and manufacture of drugs, chemistry allows you</p>
